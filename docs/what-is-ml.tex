\section{What is Machine Learning?}

Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data.

\subsection{Key Concepts}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Supervised Learning}: Learning with labeled data.
\item \textbf{Unsupervised Learning}: Discovering patterns from unlabeled data.
\item \textbf{Reinforcement Learning}: Learning to make sequences of decisions.
\end{itemize}

\[
\text{Goal:} \quad \min_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_{(x, y) \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ L(f_{\theta}(x), y) \right]
\]
